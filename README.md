# My Wallet 

## About

My Wallet Project is a web application that enables users to control their personal finances. It has a front-end, back-end and database deployed in the cloud. The project was separated into two different repositories, one for the front-end and one for the back-end, using Git for versioning. The back-end was architected in controllers, routers and middlewares, while the front-end was built using ReactJS. User registration was implemented, capable of creating an account by validating fields and passwords. The application also allows users to log in, view their transactions and add new ones.

## Motivation
The My Wallet Project was developed to provide an easy-to-use web application that helps people manage their finances. The inspiration came from the need to have a single tool that could provide a comprehensive view of one's financial situation, including a summary of expenses, income and investments.
